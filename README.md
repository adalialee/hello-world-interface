# hello-world-interface

For this mini coding assignment, I rendered "Hello, World!" by creating a React function rendering a header with this text. Additionally, I styled the heading using CSS.

To run my code:
1) Clone my repository
2) Open the terminal
3) Enter "npm start" into the terminal
4) View my "Hello World!" site

Desgn choices and resources/tutorials:
I'm currently taking a web development course, so I used parts from the assignment description to complete this project: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LBfWzHFJNE8A-67koTIMqFIaV3tMumSLttCiWSbWhGY/edit#heading=h.5wxiu9497nhh. When I wanted clarifications on smaller questions/issues, I would ask ChatGPT. I chose blue for the styling because it's my favorite color.

Everything should be working properly, but please let me know if not.
