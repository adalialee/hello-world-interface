# hello-world-interface

For this mini coding assignment, I rendered "Hello, World!" by creating a React function rendering a header with this text. Additionally, I styled the heading using CSS.

To run my code:
1) Clone my repository
2) Open the terminal
3) Enter "npm start" into the terminal
4) View my "Hello World!" site

Everything should be working properly, but please let me know if not!
